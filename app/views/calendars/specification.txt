Variables:
- All events are in @events
- Time is stored in  @times
- Days are stored in @days
- <% @events.each do |event|%> will assign each event as event.
  We can access each variable such as event.varialbe_name from here
  (ex. event.start_time or event.title)

  Specifications for data types:
  - title, start_meridian, end_meridian : string
  - start_time, end_time : datetime => check SQL dataypes

Jobs:
- Fill up events on the calendar.
- dates should be varied corresponding to week.
- Don't worry about having two events at the same time for now. Don't worry about
  corner cases.

- We want these two objectives to be accomplished by 3/2.
